I took over the library website when I became a librarian, and with only a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, I taught myself how to use bootstrap and work in the framework of the Libguides structure which is what the library uses to host its site. You can build a perfectly functioning and usable library website with great features, without knowing any code. But then your website looks like every other academic library website. I designed all the major aspects and used the University's prescibed color palette to make something that was united with the University's marketing materials, but still completely ours.

It then allows you to modify a few options, delete selections, and then export the document to be saved as a PDF. I put this together in a couple days, error tested it, we've only used it a couple months and saw an instant increase in usage, inquiries and positive feedback.
