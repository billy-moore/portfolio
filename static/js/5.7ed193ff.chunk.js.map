I really wanted to make something to prove I had learned something in React. I came up with the \n                  mechanics for the game quickly as a push-your-luck game where your high score is tied to your cash on hand. I created everything you see on the screen, the icons, shovels, everything but a very light 8-bit button CSS library. I created the tiles and icons \n                  using <a href='https://www.pixilart.com' alt='...' target='_blank' rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pixilart.com</a> and then just kept cleaning up code and \n                  adding as I learned. This was a chance to use, and build around React's Context API, learn how to use useReducer and a utilize a fun randomization algorithm. It's a fully functioning game that has some really cool features and functionality, while looking\n                  nice and tells a fun story.\n                </p>\n          </GridItem>\n          \n          <GridItem xs={12} sm={4}>\n          <a href='https://billy-moore.github.io/stream-counter/' target='_blank' rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className={classes.link}>\n                <img\n                  src={streamCounter}\n                  alt=\"stream counter\"\n                  style={{width:'100%', borderRadius: '10px', border: 'solid 2px #e4e4e4'}}\n                />\n                <h3>Stream Counter</h3>\n                </a>\n          </GridItem>\n          <GridItem xs={12} sm={8} style={{color: 'black'}}>\n              <h3>Twitch Stream Counter</h3>\n              <p>A real world application to fix an issue I was facing at the time. I needed a stream counter for a live Twitch stream, and realized that all the options were overly complicated\n                and most locked as Windows only apps, which wasn't an option. \"Well, I'm a programmer...\" I thought, so I sat down and made one. And \n                like every project, it started out as the standard \"counter\" tutorial then I added a ton of features to cater to \n                whatever type of stream might be necessary. I used this as an opportunity to learn more about Material-UI. Also uses Context API, imports a color picking utility, and allows for some cool customization to a simple app.\n              </p>\n          </GridItem>\n\n          <GridItem xs={12} sm={4} style={{paddingTop: '50px'}}>\n          <a href='https://github.com/billy-moore/player-queue.git' target='_blank' rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className={classes.link}>\n                <img\n                  src={playerQ}\n                  alt=\"player queue\"\n                  style={{width:'100%', borderRadius: '10px', border: 'solid 2px #e4e4e4'}}\n                />\n                <h3>Player Queue App</h3>\n                </a>\n          </GridItem>\n          <GridItem xs={12} sm={8} style={{color: 'black'}}>\n              <h3>Player Queue</h3>\n              <p>I volunteer with kids, and a popular game was Smash Ultimate. This app also answered a real-world issue, since there were always\n                more kids than controllers. This app was a way to make sure everyone got their turn. The app allows for\n                users to input names, and queus the names accordingly. You can hold/lock players into position, add more names \n                and even remove or add controller spots as needed.
